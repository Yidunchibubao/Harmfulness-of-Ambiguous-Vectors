Distributional vectors summarize word contexts to model meaning, but ambiguous words average distinct senses, potentially distorting results. The extent of this harm is unclear. Using lexicons that flag ambiguity, we can restrict to unambiguous words and measure morphological performance. How crucial is lexical ambiguity?
